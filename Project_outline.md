## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Planning
- Define objectives and use cases (e.g., personal well-being, workplace stress management).
- Select datasets for training (e.g., AffectNet, FER-2013).
- Review existing models and architectures for emotion detection.

### Phase 2: Dataset Preparation
- Download and preprocess datasets:
  - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 48x48).
  - Normalize pixel values.
  - Perform data augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping).
- Split datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Phase 3: Model Development
- Train a CNN-based model for emotion detection:
  - Use pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or EfficientNet for transfer learning.
  - Fine-tune the model on the selected dataset.
- Save the trained model for real-time inference.

### Phase 4: Real-Time Emotion Tracking
- Use OpenCV to capture video from a webcam.
- Detect faces in real-time using Haar cascades or Dlib.
- Predict emotions for each detected face using the trained model.
- Display the detected emotion and confidence score on the video feed.

### Phase 5: Stress Level Estimation
- Analyze emotional patterns over time to estimate stress levels.
- Define thresholds for stress levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
- Provide recommendations based on detected stress levels.

### Phase 6: Deployment
- Build a Flask or FastAPI application to serve the model.
- Create an API endpoint for emotion detection.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation
- Test the system with real-world data to evaluate accuracy and performance.
- Collect feedback and refine the model and application.
